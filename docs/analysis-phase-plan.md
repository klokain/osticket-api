# OSTicket Process Model Analysis Phase - Detailed Plan

## Phase 1: Core Process Discovery & Documentation
**Duration**: 3-5 days

### 1.1 Business Process Identification
- **Ticket Lifecycle Processes**:
  - Analyze ticket creation, assignment, routing, and closure workflows
  - Document state transitions and validation rules
  - Map permission requirements for each state change
  - Identify triggers (manual actions, email, API, cron jobs)

- **Communication & Thread Management**:
  - Document email processing pipeline (inbound/outbound)
  - Analyze thread creation, replies, notes, and internal communication
  - Map auto-response and notification workflows
  - Document attachment handling and file management

- **Assignment & Routing Logic**:
  - Analyze department assignment rules
  - Document staff/team assignment workflows  
  - Map escalation and SLA management processes
  - Document filter actions and automated processing

### 1.2 Technical Process Architecture Analysis
- **Event & Signal System**:
  - Map OSTicket's signal/event dispatching system
  - Document observers and event handlers
  - Identify async vs synchronous operations

- **Database Transaction Patterns**:
  - Analyze data consistency mechanisms
  - Document multi-table update patterns
  - Map ORM relationship dependencies

- **Permission & Security Model**:
  - Document role-based access control workflows
  - Map authentication/authorization checkpoints
  - Analyze session and API key validation

### 1.3 Integration Points Analysis  
- **External System Interfaces**:
  - Email server integration (IMAP/POP3/SMTP)
  - Plugin architecture and hooks
  - Cron job processing workflows
  - File storage and attachment processing

## Phase 2: Process Model Documentation 
**Duration**: 2-3 days

### 2.1 Create Linear Issues for Documentation Tasks
- Create structured Linear issues for each major process area
- Set up project milestones and tracking
- Assign priority levels based on API development impact

### 2.2 Process Flow Documentation
- **Visual Process Maps**: Create workflow diagrams for each major process
- **State Transition Matrices**: Document valid state changes and triggers
- **Data Flow Diagrams**: Map how data moves through the system
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Document multi-component interactions

### 2.3 API Impact Analysis
- **Resource Mapping**: Map processes to potential REST API endpoints
- **Dependency Analysis**: Identify process interdependencies for API design
- **Security Requirements**: Document authentication/authorization needs
- **Performance Considerations**: Identify resource-intensive operations

## Phase 3: Development Foundation Setup
**Duration**: 1-2 days

### 3.1 Documentation Organization
- Create structured documentation in project repository
- Set up templates for API endpoint documentation
- Establish process documentation standards
- Create reference materials for development team

### 3.2 Next Phase Planning
- Define API development priorities based on process analysis
- Create development roadmap with Linear project management
- Establish testing strategy for each process area
- Plan API versioning and backward compatibility approach

## Expected Deliverables:
1. **Comprehensive Process Documentation** - Detailed workflows with diagrams
2. **Linear Project Structure** - Organized issues and milestones
3. **API Development Roadmap** - Prioritized endpoint development plan
4. **Technical Architecture Overview** - Foundation for API development
5. **Development Guidelines** - Standards and patterns for implementation

This analysis phase will provide the essential process understanding needed to design and implement a comprehensive REST API that properly handles OSTicket's complex business logic and maintains data integrity.

## Background Context

From the initial codebase analysis, we have identified that OSTicket has a rich data model but lacks comprehensive documentation of its business processes. The current API is limited to ticket creation only (`/api/tickets.json`), but the system contains extensive business logic for:

- Complex ticket lifecycle management with states and transitions
- Multi-level permission systems (departments, teams, staff roles)
- Dynamic forms and custom field handling
- Email integration and automated processing
- SLA management and escalation workflows
- Collaboration features and thread management

This process analysis phase is critical for understanding how these components interact and ensuring that the new REST API properly handles all business rules and maintains data integrity during operations.
